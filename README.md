#Image Forgery Detection Using Deep Learning 
*Implemented Deep Learning Models Using Image Processing Techniques for the Image
Forgery Detection.
*Built a TensorFlow Sequential Model with ELA(Error Level Analysis) Pre-Processing
*Techniques and Used Transfer Learning based Pretrained Models VGG16 and VGG19 to
detect Image Forgery in JPEG Images.
*Analyzed and detected the Image Tampering "Copy_move" forgery
and Image Splicing in JPEG(lossy format) Images.
*Compared the 3 Models to gain a deeper understanding of their performance.
